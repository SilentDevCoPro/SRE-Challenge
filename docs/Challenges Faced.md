# Challenges Faced

## Unknowns going into project
- No experience with running Reddis on k8s
- I have not run a node service before, however I do not see any complications with a simple service, as I have used React.
- I have no tried chaos engineering before, this should be exciting!

## Challenges Faced During project
### #1 Challenge
Selecting which node API dependencies to use, Express was selected due to it being recommended to someone
who is familiar with FastApi.

### #2 Challenge
I have never written a Nodejs API endpoint before, good learning curve understanding how the prometheus metrics
scraping was going to happen. Using a "Middleware" function was not something I was familiar with but makes sense
for timing the API calls response time.

### #3 Challenge
Getting images into Minikube is a pain in the backside, I have documented the process so it is easier in the future.

### #4 Challenge

### #5 Challenge
